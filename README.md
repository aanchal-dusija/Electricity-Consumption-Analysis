# Electricity Consumption Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive project on analyzing electricity consumption patterns. The project includes various scripts and notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization techniques.

The Electricity Consumption and Occupancy (ECO) dataset is a publicly available dataset that contains information about the energy consumption and occupancy of a commercial building over a period of time. The dataset was created to support research on building energy management and sustainability.

The ECO dataset includes data on the electricity consumption of various systems and devices within the building, such as lighting, HVAC, and plug loads. The data is collected at a high frequency, typically every second of the day. The dataset also includes information on the occupancy of the building at different times of the day, which is typically measured using occupancy sensors or manually recorded data.

The ECO dataset is available in several different formats, including raw data files and pre-processed data files. The raw data files contain the original data collected from the buildingâ€™s meters and sensors, while the pre-processed data files contain aggregated data that has been cleaned and normalized for easier analysis. The pre-processed data files may also include additional information, such as weather data, to help contextualize the energy consumption and occupancy data.

The ECO dataset has been used in a variety of research studies related to building energy management and sustainability. For example, the dataset has been used to develop and test algorithms for energy management systems, to analyze patterns in energy consumption and occupancy, and to evaluate the effectiveness of energy-saving interventions. The dataset is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of building energy management and sustainability, as it provides a detailed and comprehensive view of energy consumption and occupancy in a real-world commercial building.

### Features:
